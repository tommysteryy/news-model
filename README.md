# Article Popularity Investigation
This project will explore optimal variables in your news articles. Correlations and regressions will be made to predict optimal levels of variables like word count, polarity, and image numbers. 
To conclude, the project will feature an interactable prediction model where users can input variables of their own and predict the number of shares they can get with certain fixed variables (like word count etc). Possibility to include potential improvement areas as well.
My list of ideas:
- Do some explorative plotting and also self-analysis. Which variables are most likely manipulatible in an article, and which will be most of interest?
- Pick variables and plots that you'll use for your project. Aim for 5-7 interesting and RELEVANT ones.
- Use dsci or calculus to determine optimal levels of each variable.
- Build the classification model based on all these variables. Only two class variables - shared or not shared.
