# Article Popularity Investigation
This project will explore optimal variables in your news articles. Correlations and regressions will be made to predict optimal levels of variables like word count, polarity, and image numbers. 
To conclude, the project will feature an interactable prediction model where users can input variables of their own and predict the number of shares they can get with certain fixed variables (like word count etc). Possibility to include potential improvement areas as well.
